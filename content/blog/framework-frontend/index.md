The “State of JavaScript” report is an annual survey that records and — thanks to guest data visualization expert Amelia Wattenberger — beautifully illustrates the opinions of more than 21,000 developers around the world. First issued in 2016 by designer and developer Sacha Grief, the latest edition covers frontend web development frameworks, databases, state management, relationships between frameworks, reception and ease of use, languages that compile to JavaScript mobile frameworks, build tools, JavaScript testing tools, and a whole lot more.
