## Problems with traditional project processes

### Waterfall VS Agile
Agile tries to address some of the issues commonly encountered in software development using the traditional Waterfall method. The Waterfall method is used in projects such as manufacturing and construction projects (and even hardware / mechanical projects) and it was a natural progression many years ago to adopt it into software projects. 

Waterfall is still a valid process, but it is a sequential development process whereby you don't move onto the next step until the previous step is fully completed (see figure below). Any changes to the project after the requirements have been frozen can lead to major headaches due to rework of the design, updating documentation, contract negotiation, changing the test setup, etc. This becomes very costly, especially depending on how far into the project you are, because Waterfall isn't optimized for changes that naturally happen during a software project. Agile does not eliminate the additional work when a change is required, but it identifies and addresses it earlier, leading to decreased cost and a better chance of meeting the expectations of the customer. For example, if a product is only demonstrated for the customer after 1 - 2 years, there's a good chance the product will not perform as expected, or the customer's original requirements may have changed.

Traditional project processes are also very "top-down" managed. For example, the requirements may have been discussed and agreed upon with little input from the development team, and then passed from the project manager to the team for design and implementation. Compare this to Agile, which focuses on having a "self-organised" team.

## The difference with Agile

The four Agile Manifesto values are to be used as a high level starting point to drive the Agile process. An important thing to note with the Agile Manifesto values is that the items on the left are more valued than the items on the right. A common misconception is that the items on the right have zero or no value. This is not correct - the items on the right are valuable, we just value the items on the left more.happiness, usage by company size and salary range, show of interest, ease of use, and reach.

####1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

People and communication should be responding to business needs and driving development. It is more important to have people collaborating and working together as a team, than focusing on a specific process or tool. Processes and tools can help facilitate this process, but it's more important to get people interacting together.

####2. Working software over comprehensive documentation

Although it is important to have documentation, the documentation becomes irrelevant if the software doesn't work.

####3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

In traditional processes such as waterfall, any changes that weren't signed off in the original contract may be strongly opposed. In software projects, requirements and expectations change frequently, so it's important that we collaborate with the customer regularly during the development process to ensure we deliver a final product that satisfies expectations.

####4. Responding to change over following a plan

In Agile, change is expected and adds value to the project. Although we should agree to a plan, we should expect to change that plan as we go through the project.
